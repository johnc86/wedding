<p>You'll be drinking lots of Vodka, so start preparing your body! A Polish wedding party is quite different to an English wedding.</p>
<p>The party starts immediately after the wedding ceremony and transport to the venue will be available.</p>
<p><b>Rooms at the venue are limited and <u>reserved for close family or those who need to look after young children</u>. If you would like to put your name down for a room at the party venue please contact us to chat. However, the venue is only a short 15 minute ride back to the city. We'll be making sure everybody gets back to their hotel safely afterwards.</b></p>
<p>To summarise the actual party - it basically comes in waves. You'll be fed, we'll drink some vodka and then we'll dance. After a short while, more food will come and we repeat until sunrise. Yes, a Polish wedding usually goes on til the early hours. The steady intake of food and mandatory dancing should be enough to keep you sober. The tradition is to do a shot at various times throughout the evening, so <em>pace yourself</em>.</p>
<p>There is no bar, the alcohol will be provided by us. So, if you drink everything on your table within 20 minutes you might be getting a hangover by the end of the night... The aim is to be still going strong by 4am!</p>
<p>Throughout the night there will be various activities and games accompaniedby a DJ and a translator - they're both experienced in Polish/ English wedding parties, so everything will be made clear throught. We're sure that after a few rounds the language barrier will disappear and we're also providing somee useful phrases below to get your started!</p>
