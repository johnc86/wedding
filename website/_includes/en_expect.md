<h1>Other information</h1>
<h2>Dress code</h2>
<p>We would describe the dress code as formal, which is the default for Polish weddings. There is no theme. Just make sure you have comfortable dancing shoes!</p>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>We excpect everyone will be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. As of the 23rd January 2022, you are also required to present a negative result of the COVID-19 test taken within 24 hours before crossing the Polish border (this can be either a Lateral Flow or PCR test). This may change in the coming month though, so we will update this section if there are any changes to the guidance. You can find out more on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/poland/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19">GOV.UK</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/coronavirus/outside-the-european-union-schengen-area-turkey">GOV.PL.</a></p>
