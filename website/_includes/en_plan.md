<h1>Plan your trip</h1>
<p>Things are hard to plan these days, but to help you figure things out we've pulled together the most obvious ways to fly and places to stay to help you get started.</p>

<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>Bydgoszcz is a relatively small city, it does have a local airport but the only direct flight to the UK is from Birmingham. There are other UK airports you can fly from, but they'll take you to other cities in Poland and you'll have to get transport from there to Bydgoszcz. This can often work out cheaper, because everything is cheaper in Poland. A bus from Gdansk to Bydgoszcz is around £15. It's more like a transfer minibus that you can pre-book.</p>

<h2>Hotels</h2>
<p>Here are a few hotels that have been recommended to us. We'd also suggest checking out Airbnb as there are some great (cheap!) places to stay. Some hotels don't have English websites, so we'd recommend checking them out through sites like booking.com. Many offer free cancellations until August/September in case something changes with COVID so be sure to check for that.</p>

<h2>Things to do</h2>
<p>Bydgoszcz is a smaller city but it's very pretty and there are some fun things to check out. As well as museums, galleries, gorgeous churches and fantastic food, it's lovely to take walk around the Old Town and the little cobbled streets surrounding it. Maybe stop for a giant scoop of ice-cream on the way. You can take a look at the <a href="https://visitbydgoszcz.pl/en/explore/what-to-see">city's attractions here.</a> </p>

<p>If  you're planning on staying a little longer, Toruń is the next nearest city. As well as being the birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus and home of the best gingerbread in the world, it's very old and beautiful. <a href="https://www.torun.pl/en">Take a look here.</a></p>

<p>It's also easy to get the train to Warsaw, Kraków, Wrocław or Poznań if you want to explore further. These bigger cities aren't as cheap as Bydgoszcz but obviously there are lots of attractions if you plan on doing a longer holiday.</p>
