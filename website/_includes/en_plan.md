<h1>Plan your trip</h1>
<p>Things are hard to plan these days, but to help you figure things out we've pulled together the most obvious ways to fly and places to stay to help you get started.</p>

<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>Bydgoszcz is a relatively small city, it does have a local airport but the only direct flight to the UK is from Birmingham. There are other UK airports you can fly from, but they'll take you to other cities in Poland and you'll have to get transport from there to Bydgoszcz. This can often work out cheaper, because everything is cheaper in Poland. A a bus from Gdansk to Bydgoszcz is around Â£15, and it's not a ghetto arriva. It's more like a transfer coach, you pre-book, the driver sorts your luggage and last time we went it was a 12-seat Mercedes that was very comfortable.</p>

<h2>Things to do</h2>
<p>Bydgoszcz is a smaller city but there are some fun thigns to check out.</p>
<p>It's easy to get the train or a plane to Warsaw or Krakow if you want to explore further. These bigger cities aren't as cheap as Bydgoszcz with more tourist traps but obviously lots of attractions if you plan on doing a longer holiday.</p>
