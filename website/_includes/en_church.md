<h1>The Church</h1>
<div class="map-pin">
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aEmMT7dcigrc1UDn7" target="_blank"><p><b>Kościół Wniebowstąpienia Pańskiego, ul. Atolowa 6, Osowa Góra, 85-435 Bydgoszcz.</b></p></a>
</div>
<p>The church is located a little outside the city, so we will be providing transport from the city centre (and afterwards to the party). You can make your own way there if you prefer, there is some parking available and a bus stop nearby.
</p>
<p>The ceremony starts at 5pm, we'll be contacting everyone to confirm the time for the transport.</p>
<p>The ceremony itself will be very similar to an English Catholic wedding, just in Polish. There will be a translator who will explain what's happening, and the priest is aware that half of the congregation won't speak Polish so don't worry, there won't be any confusion.
